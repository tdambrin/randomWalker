# RandomWalker (code)

Implement the random walker algorithm of scikit-image.<br/>
Seeding must be user-performed and can contain up to 5 labels (at least 2 required)<br/>
Inspiration for interactive seeding from (https://github.com/julie-jiang/image-segmentation)<br/>
To seed the image with the graphical interface (requires accurate marking), follow the instructions : <br/>
- Add seeds with cursor
- Adjust cursos size with -/+
- Press ENTER to seed with next label
- Press DEL to seed with previous label
- Press ECHAP to stop seeding

# Graph based approaches for image segmentation

The pdf file contains a brief state-of-the-art of graph based approaches. Featuring Random Walker, Graph-cuts and Watershed Cuts. <br/>
Its objective is to introduce the overall principles and properties of these tree methods.<br/>It is in no way a complete graph based approaches analysis.
